# Step 1 Getting connected with GitHub

## Create a repository on GitHub

## Clone the new repository

To do this go to the main page for the repository you just created then click on code and copy the HTTPS link.  On the Terminal (Linux or Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) cd into the folder where you want the repository.   I perfer to put things in the default place for Clion in a folder called CLionProjects.  If you were to do the same than you would use the following command

```` cd C:\Users\[USER]\CLionProjects\ ````


Once you are in the folder where you want your repository and type 

```` git clone [HTTPS LINK] ````

where [HTTPS LINK] is the link you copied.  This will copy all of the files from GitHub into the specified folder.  It will also make a hidden folder called .git which stores relevant information to making sure your repository works properly.

# Step 2 Intall IDE and Text Editor

## Set up an Programming Environment

Download your favorite IDE (integrated development environment) and/or Text Editor.  All programming can be done using either an IDE or a Text Editor.  My favorite IDE for C++ is Clion, it is a paid environment but if you sign in with your student email than yuou can get it for free.  I would recommend using this.  Another popular IDE is Visual Studio.  

I would recommend getting both an IDE and a Text Editor because it is ofcten easier to look at files in a Text Editor rather than an IDE but it will be much easier to program using an IDE.  In terms of Text Editors I use Sublime 3 (free).  Other options are Notepad++, Atom, Emacs.
